/**
 * Google Drive, server-side. The only place the organisation's credential is
 * ever held.
 *
 * ## Why a refresh token and not a service account
 *
 * A service account is the obvious answer and it does not work here. Service
 * accounts have **no Drive storage quota of their own**: an upload into a
 * folder shared with them fails `storageQuotaExceeded`, because the service
 * account would own the resulting file and it has nowhere to put it. The
 * documented fix is a Shared Drive, which requires Google Workspace — this
 * project runs on a consumer Gmail account.
 *
 * So the app acts *as the folder's owner*, using a refresh token that owner
 * granted once (`npm run drive:connect`). Files land in their Drive, on their
 * quota, owned by them. That is a real consequence and not a workaround: the
 * organiser is now underwriting storage for their entrants, which is the
 * trade ADR-026 records.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * `drive.file` — per-file access, granted only to files this app creates. It
 * cannot read anything else in the owner's Drive, which is why the consent
 * screen is not asking for a restricted scope and why a leak of this token is
 * bounded to files we made.
 *
 * No `googleapis` SDK: three REST calls do not justify a dependency that
 * dominates a serverless cold start.
