/**
 * Cloud Functions for Podium.
 *
 * ⚠️  **NOT DEPLOYED — but executed and tested.**
 *
 * The project is on the Spark plan, which has no Cloud Functions, so none of
 * this has run *in production*. It is written and waiting: `npm --prefix
 * functions run deploy` the day billing is enabled.
 *
 * The emulator, however, has no plan restriction, and that is where these are
 * verified: `npm run test:functions` starts the Firestore and
 * Functions emulators, writes real documents, and asserts what each trigger
 * wrote (see `../verify.mjs` — 22 assertions across all four functions,
 * including a real local HTTP receiver that recomputes the webhook HMAC). So
 * "compiles clean" is no longer the only evidence. What the emulator cannot
 * prove is hosting, not code: IAM, region placement, cold-start limits, and
 * egress to the public internet (which Spark blocks).
 *
 * Each function here either **retires a documented trade-off** or **unblocks a
 * Phase 3 feature that cannot exist client-side**:
 *
 * | Function              | Replaces / unblocks                              |
 * |-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
 * | `onRegistrationWrite` | ADR-019 — client-incremented counters             |
 * | `onSubmissionWrite`   | ADR-019 — submission counter                      |
 * | `onScoreWrite`        | Stale leaderboards; SPEC_SCORING §4               |
 * | `dispatchWebhook`     | Phase 3 — signed webhooks (needs a server secret) |
 *
 * After deploying, go and **tighten the rules back**: `leaderboard` and
 * `certificates` return to `write: if false`, and the challenge-update rule
 * drops its `counters` escape hatch. Those relaxations exist only because there
 * was no server; leaving them once there is one would be the worst of both.
