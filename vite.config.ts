    /**
     * Installable PWA — ROADMAP 1.17.
     *
     * The caching strategy is where the thought went. Two rules drive it:
     *
     * 1. **Never cache Firestore or Auth.** Their traffic is authenticated and
     *    frequently mutated; a stale cached response would show one person
     *    another person's data or resurrect a deleted challenge. The Firestore
     *    SDK already has its own IndexedDB persistence (`core/firebase/app.ts`)
     *    which understands documents, permissions and invalidation — a service
     *    worker caching the same requests by URL would fight it and lose.
     * 2. **Cache what is immutable and expensive.** Hashed build assets, fonts,
     *    and Drive-hosted cover images are all safe to serve from cache.
