/**
 * The key gate in front of the admin panel.
 *
 * Two conditions, in this order, because they fail for different reasons and
 * deserve different screens: you must be **signed in** (the panel is tied to an
 * account — its audit entries name you), and you must know the **access key**.
 *
 * ## What this gate is and is not
 *
 * It is not security, and the screen says so rather than implying otherwise.
 * The key is compared in the browser against a value that ships in the bundle
 * (see the header of `core/auth/adminKey.ts`), so it decides who is *shown* the
 * console, not who can change anything. Everything the console does is a
 * Firestore write evaluated against `firestore.rules` and the caller's stored
 * membership — force this gate and you get the chrome and a wall of
 * `permission-denied`.
 *
 * Saying that out loud in the UI is deliberate. A gate that looks like a vault
 * gets treated like one, and someone eventually puts something behind it that
 * needed a real lock.
