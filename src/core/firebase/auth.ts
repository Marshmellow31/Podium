 *
 * * **Email and password** — the method that works for everyone, and the only
 *   one the admin door accepts. We own reset and verification, which is why
 *   both live here rather than being left to the caller.
 * * **Google** — one tap for a participant who has an account already, and it
 *   arrives `emailVerified`, so an invite is redeemable immediately. The cost
 *   ADR-024 named is real and unchanged: it needs an authorized-domain entry
 *   per host, and `explain()` in `AuthContext` says exactly that when it bites.
 * Signing in also **provisions**: it creates `users/{uid}` and redeems a pending
 * invite if one is addressed to this verified address (ADR-020). That is the
 * only route to a real permission, and it is the reason `provision` refreshes
 * the ID token before touching Firestore — the `email_verified` claim is baked
 * in when the token is minted.

 * offline or throttled client rejects that call with `unavailable` — the single
 * most likely error on the flakiest connection, turned into an error message
 * about credentials.

 * The two writes inside already reason this way individually (see their `catch`
 * blocks). This extends the same rule to the reads and to the user document,
