/**
 * The admin panel's access key.
 *
 * ## Read this before trusting it
 *
 * This key is checked **in the browser**, against a value that ships in the
 * JavaScript bundle. Anyone who opens devtools can read it, and anyone who can
 * read it can set the unlock flag by hand. It is therefore a **gate, not a
 * lock**: it keeps the admin surface out of the way of people who have no
 * business in it, and it stops an idle tab on a shared laptop from being one
 * click from the console. It does not make the panel safe against someone who
 * wants in.
 *
 * That is not a compromise this file can fix. AGENT.md hard rule 3 — the
 * client is never the authority — is why it does not have to: *every action*
 * the panel offers is a Firestore write, and Firestore evaluates
 * `firestore.rules` against the caller's stored membership, not against
 * anything in this module. Someone who forces the gate open sees the panel
 * chrome and gets `permission-denied` on everything they try to change. The
 * panel is a shortcut for people who already hold the permissions, and the key
 * decides who is *shown* it.
 *
 * The real lock is the RBAC role on your membership document (SPEC_RBAC §6).
 * If you need the key itself to be authoritative, it has to move behind a
 * Cloud Function that mints a custom claim — which needs Blaze, and is written
 * up as the upgrade path in ADR-024.
